    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.</li>
        <li>Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).</li>
        <li>Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. </li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour Â¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.</li>
        <li>When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!</li>
    </ol>
